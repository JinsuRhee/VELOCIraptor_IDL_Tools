All tables are re-arranged by Jinsu for them to have the same format with the original BC03 SSP data

1) lambda.dat
	wavelength array [A]

2) age_yy_bc.dat
	age array [Gyr]

3) bc03_chab_X.XXXX
	SSP flux with metalicity of X.XXXX
	The array contains the total number of components of (age X wavelength)
	Unit is the flux density normalized by L_sun of the total mass of 1 M_sun
		[(F_lambda / Lsun) * A^-1 * Msun^-1)]
	IMF as Chabrier is used
